# FRC-2018 Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this repository, the following guidelines should be kept in mind: 

* We use the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) when writing C++ code and as such, contributions to the repository are also expected to hold to the same guidelines stated there. 
* Code must be properly documented, that is, functions, structures, classes, enumerations, etc. must all contain proper documentation. We typically write documentation comments in a style similar to that laid out by [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/), but it is fine to submit code with comments formatted in a non-standard way (the comments will often be normalized, however).
* Your contributions (pull requests) **must** contain adequate descriptions of the changes implemented, and the means by which they were implemented. Failing to do so will result in pulls requests being denied a merge. If we don't know what your code does, and how it does that, we can't implement it! 

As long as the above three points are kept in mind and followed as best as possible, any contribution submitted should be good to go!
